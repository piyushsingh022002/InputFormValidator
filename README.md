# InputFormValidator
I built a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that takes user input and checks if it's valid. If there's a mistake, like an empty field or mismatched passwords, an error message pops up. But if everything looks good, the user gets a friendly greeting alert on the screen.
